       /* Q1 : does the folder name (e.g., src, liveReview) have to start with lowercase ?
        package and directory names should start with lowercase
        Q2 : System.out.print.ln(4+5 +" " + 4+5) it gives me 9 45 on the console.
                Why it is not doing addition after the space?so, Why is it concatenating instead of adding after space?

        OPERATORS
                * Arithmetic Operators
                - , + , / , * and modulus % (gives us remainder)
* Relational Operators : When we use relational operators result is BOOLEAN
        > greater than sign
        < less than sign
        >= greater equal
        <= less than equal
        == equal
        != not equal

    * Logical Operators
      & And operator , && Bitwise And Operator
      | Or operator , || Bitwise Or operator

  * Control Flow Statements ---> Conditional Statements

      if(condition){do this} else {go here if it is false}

      if(condition1) - else if(condition 2) - else{}
